# HackyTime with PizzaOps

This repository is simply a collection of things I want to remember how to do later, most of which are hacky garbage.

Caveat emptor!

The name of this repo is an intentional tribute to [Adrien Thebo's](https://twitter.com/nullfinch) [hackybot](https://github.com/adrienthebo/hackybot).

The only commit message you will ever see here is `HackyTime!`. If you want to actually know what's new, simply list the changed files for a commit.i
This is not an application, and there are no dependencies between files, no libraries beyond perhaps requires in the individual files, etc.
